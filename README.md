## About me
I am an evolutionary biologist interested in understanding biological diversity and why organisms look the way they do. This requires understanding the causal relationships between development and evolution. My approach is centered around predictive modeling and system identification of evolution and development as dynamical systems. I am also interested in the connections between this dynamical description and quantitative genetics.
